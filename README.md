# "Advanced Steel Property" Dataset
The "Advanced Steel Property dataset" is a dataset relevant for a classification and a regression task in Multi-Task Learning (MTL), where the tasks show heterogeneity between the tasks. The dataset is relevant for object classification and its regression-based property modeling, without any object-localization requirement, while performing the two tasks. Each image is annotated with a classification label and a regression label. More specifically, the object classes indicate different steel types, particularly their microstructures (occupying the entire image frame), while the continuous property variable is the material hardness in the present case.
